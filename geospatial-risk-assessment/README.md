## Project Overview

The Geospatial Risk Assessment (GRA) system processes and analyzes location data to assess risk factors for insurance purposes. By integrating diverse geospatial data sources such as satellite imagery, weather data, and population density, the system provides a comprehensive risk evaluation framework.

Key achievements:
- 15% reduction in operational costs
- 20% improvement in risk assessment accuracy
- Enhanced decision-making capabilities for underwriters

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Combine and process diverse geospatial data sources
- **Risk Analysis**: Implement advanced algorithms that evaluate location-specific risk factors
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provide real-time risk assessment and data visualization
- **Risk Explanation**: Break down contributing factors to specific risk scores
- **Policy Pricing**: Translate risk scores into actionable premium calculations

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with GeoPandas, Shapely, NumPy, and Pandas
- **Data Visualization**: Folium, Plotly, Matplotlib
- **Web Interface**: Flask, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for risk prediction models
- **Geospatial Processing**: GDAL/OGR libraries

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Generate sample data:
   ```bash
   cd data
   python generate_sample_data.py
   ```
4. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser

## Directory Structure

- `/src` - Core modules for geospatial processing and risk scoring
- `/data` - Sample datasets and data generation tools
- `/dashboard` - Web-based dashboard application
- `/notebooks` - Jupyter notebooks with analysis examples
- `/documentation` - User guides and technical documentation

## Documentation

- [User Guide](documentation/USER_GUIDE.md) - Complete instructions for using the GRA system
- [API Documentation](documentation/API.md) - Details on programmatic integration

## Demo

Run the demo script to see the GRA system in action:

```bash
cd src
python demo.py
```

This will:
1. Generate sample geospatial regions
2. Calculate risk factors for each region
3. Implement the risk scoring algorithm
4. Produce visualizations of the risk assessment
5. Output premium calculations based on risk scores
