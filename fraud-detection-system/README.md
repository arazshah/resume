## Project Overview

The Claims Fraud Detection System (FDS) analyzes patterns in insurance claims data, with a special focus on geographical distributions and anomalies. By integrating geospatial information with machine learning algorithms, the system provides a comprehensive fraud detection framework.

Key achievements:
- 25% improvement in fraud detection accuracy
- Significant reduction in false positives
- Faster identification of suspicious claim patterns

## Features

- **Geospatial Analysis**: Identify suspicious claim patterns based on geographic location
- **Machine Learning Models**: Detect anomalies and flag potential fraud using advanced algorithms
- **Real-time Alert System**: Notify investigators immediately about suspicious claims
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize claim data and fraud indicators in an intuitive interface
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate detailed reports for highlighted suspicious claims

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with GeoPandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow
- **Geospatial Tools**: GeoPy for geocoding, Folium for map visualization
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- **Machine Learning**: Isolation Forest, DBSCAN for anomaly detection
- **Web Interface**: Flask, Bootstrap, Plotly for interactive visualizations

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Generate sample data:
   ```bash
   cd data
   python generate_sample_data.py
   ```
4. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser

## Directory Structure

- `/src` - Core modules for fraud detection and geocoding
- `/data` - Sample datasets and data generation tools
- `/dashboard` - Web-based dashboard application
- `/notebooks` - Jupyter notebooks with analysis examples
- `/documentation` - User guides and technical documentation

## Documentation

- [User Guide](documentation/USER_GUIDE.md) - Complete instructions for using the FDS system
- [API Documentation](documentation/API.md) - Details on programmatic integration
- [Model Documentation](documentation/MODELS.md) - Information about the ML models used

## Demo

Run the demo script to see the FDS system in action:

```bash
cd src
python demo.py
```

This will:
1. Load sample claim data with geospatial information
2. Run anomaly detection algorithms on the data
3. Flag suspicious claims with confidence scores
4. Generate visualizations of claim patterns
5. Produce sample alerts and reports

## Key Innovations

1. **Geospatial Pattern Analysis**: The system identifies unusual concentrations of claims in specific geographic areas, which often indicate organized fraud rings.

2. **Multi-dimensional Anomaly Detection**: Beyond location, the system analyzes claim amounts, frequency, timing patterns, and claimant history to identify outliers.

3. **Automated Alert Prioritization**: Machine learning algorithms assign risk scores to flagged claims, helping investigators focus on the most suspicious cases first.

4. **Temporal-Spatial Analysis**: Detecting unusual patterns in how claims evolve over time in specific locations.
